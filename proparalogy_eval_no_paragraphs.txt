In this task, you'll be given a paragraph detailing a scientific process (B).
Your goal is to find the one out of four paragraphs (C1, C2, C3, C4) that describes an analogous process.
Remember, only one paragraph is the correct match.
You must carefully read and compare each to find the correct analogous process.
Analogy is a mapping between entities in two domains base and target, that relies on relational similarity, rather than object attributes.
For example, for a base paragraph about "How does an electrical circuit work?", and a target paragraph about "How does a mechanical water pump work?", there exists an analogy.
Similar relations are:
"battery generates electrical voltage", similarly to "pump produces pressure".
"electrons move through copper wire", similarly to "water flows pipe".
"resistor decrease voltage rate", similarly to "valve reduce flow rate".
Note that "battery" : "pump", "electrons" : "water", "copper wire" : "pipe" and "resistor" : "valve",
all are pair of entities one in the base and the other in target, that plays a similar role in the paragraphs.
Respond with "ANSWER: " and then "C1" or "C2" or "C3" or "C4" for the option that describes the best analogous process to the process in 'B'.

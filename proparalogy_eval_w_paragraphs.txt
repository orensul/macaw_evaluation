In this task, you'll be given a paragraph detailing a scientific process (B).
Your goal is to find the one out of four paragraphs (C1, C2, C3, C4) that describes an analogous process.
Remember, only one paragraph is the correct match. You must carefully read and compare each to find the correct analogous process.
Analogy is a mapping between entities in two domains base and target, that relies on relational similarity, rather than object attributes.
For example, for the following base paragraph:
"The battery generates electrical voltage.
This voltage creates a potential difference that causes electrons to move through the copper wire.
The electrons pass through the resistor.
The resistor presents a higher resistance to the flow of electrons, and causes a decrease in the voltage.", and the following target paragraph:
"A pump is a mechanical system that produces pressure.
The pressure is created by an impeller, which breaks down the fluid, and forces the water to flow inside the pipe.
The flow rate is regulated by a valve, which controls the amount of fluid which is allows to reduce the flow rate.", there exists an analogy.
Similar relations are:
"battery generates electrical voltage", similarly to "pump produces pressure".
"electrons move through copper wire", similarly to "water flows pipe".
"resistor decrease voltage rate", similarly to "valve reduce flow rate".
Note that "battery" : "pump", "electrons" : "water", "copper wire" : "pipe" and "resistor" : "valve",
all are pair of entities one in the base and the other in target, that plays a similar role in the paragraphs.
Respond with "ANSWER: " and then "C1" or "C2" or "C3" or "C4" for the option that describes the best analogous process to the process in 'B'.
